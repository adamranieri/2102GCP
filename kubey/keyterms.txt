node - straight up a computer (Kubenetes thinks its cool to call them nodes)

Kubernetes cluster- a master kubernetes node and the nodes it controls

Kubernetes control plane - a restful api server 
	(can also be interacted with via the command line if logged in to computer)

Kubelet - the kubernetes software on a sub node that connect that node to the control plane

===========================================================================
Kubernetes objects

Pod - an atomic piece of software. a pod is made of one or more containers.

Deployement - a configuration/formation of pods. 
	can indclude things like envrionment variables how many instances of each pod you want. when to create pods etc... 


service - allows you to access the pods on a cluster
	pods are NOT accessible from outside the cluster

Load balancer: A type of service


===========================================================================

Kubernetes is Declarative by design
	
You list what you want. Kubernetes makes it a reality and will shuffle around resources if
pods fail.

==========================================================================

Kubernetes makes deployment more "code based". Can greatly simplify maitnence of complex deployments 
kubernetes was invented by Google and is part of their philosophy that deployment is part of software development
